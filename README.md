# Coffee Shop Mobile App

### Project Overview
This project is a React Native UI implementation based on the **Coffee Shop App** Figma design.  
The goal of the challenge is to accurately translate a provided UI design into a fully functional mobile application using modern React Native tools and best practices.

### Initial Setup
I began by creating a GitHub repository named **alx-coffee-shop-app**, following the required naming convention.

The repository was then cloned locally using the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sean-techie/alx-coffee-shop-app.git
cd alx-coffee-shop-app.

The project was initialized using **Expo with TypeScript**, and **NativeWindCSS** was configured to enable Tailwind-style utility classes for styling React Native components.

### Assets & Resources
All required assets (images and icons) were extracted from the Figma design and organized into the project structure as instructed.  
These assets are stored in the `assets/` directory and are used throughout the app to closely match the original design.

### Tech Stack
- Expo
- React Native
- TypeScript
- NativeWindCSS (Tailwind for React Native)

### Objectives
- Implement all screens according to the Coffee Shop App design
- Maintain clean and reusable components
- Achieve a responsive and pixel-perfect UI
- Follow proper project structure and naming conventions
